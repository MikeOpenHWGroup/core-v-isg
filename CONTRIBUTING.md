# Contributing
Contributors are encouraged to be a [member](https://www.openhwgroup.org/membership/) of the OpenHW Group.  New members are always welcome.
## Getting Started
The [OpenHW Work Flow](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/Common/OpenHWGroup_WorkFlow.pdf) document is required reading.  You will find information about the implementation and usage of the CORE-V verification environments in the [Verification Strategy](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## The Mechanics
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [core-v-isg](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-isg) repository
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/core-v-isg`
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b <my_branch>.`<br> Please uniquify your branch name.  See the [Git Cheats](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/master/GitCheats.md) for a useful nominclature.
4. Test your changes with the sanity test (coming soon!).
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature' -s`<br>...take note of that **-s**, it's important!
6. Push feature branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. Submit a pull request
